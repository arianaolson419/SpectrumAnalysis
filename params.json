An LED array controlled by a Raspberry Pi lights up in time to music, displaying the FFT bars.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How To Use It\r\nThe music visualizer comes with a few preloaded songs. To use these songs, follow the instructions below:\r\n\r\n1. Connect the hardware components to the Raspberry Pi (see instructions under Hardware Required)\r\n2. Run web app (page.py) in a local server from the Raspberry Pi\r\n3. Choose a song from the list\r\n4. Press start. The bar graph visualizer will play on the screen while the LEDs start to light up in time with the music.\r\n\r\n### Hardware Required\r\nRaspberry Pi and connecting cables\r\nWS2812 LEDs\r\nPower supply and power jack\r\nLevel shifter\r\nBreadboard and appropriate jumper wires\r\n[Connecting LEDs](http://popoklopsi.github.io/RaspberryPi-LedStrip/#!/ws2812)\r\n\r\n### Creating visualization for a new song\r\n1. In the file AV_FFT.py, change the song_file to the directory of your song of choice\r\n2. Uncomment the Bar Graph creator section of the file and the CSV creator code(at the bottom of the page) \r\n3. Run the make.sh file to compile the frames of the song you created into an animation and export the csv file to your LED program\r\n4. Open the AV_FFT2LED.py file and copy the csv data file directory to the song_data variable, run the file which has a pipe to the OurLEDCodeFile.py\r\n5. Add the new song file to the list in the web app and put the name of the song in the index.html dropdown menu.\r\n6. You can now use this like all of the preloaded songs!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)\r\n\r\n[Ffmpeg](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu)\r\n\r\n[Rpiws281x](https://github.com/richardghirst/rpi_ws281x)\r\n\r\n[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)\r\n\r\n[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)\r\n\r\n[Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)\r\n\r\nPossible: [libRosa](https://bmcfee.github.io/librosa/install.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
