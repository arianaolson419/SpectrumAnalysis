Agenda:
* Background & Context (10 min)
* Goals (2 min)
* Future Work (3 min)
* Questions/Discussions (10)


Background/Context (What We’ve Done) 
* Have a script that takes a .wav file and generates a .csv file of FFT data and optional bar graphs for each frame.
* Have working LEDs and a Raspberry Pi that we are able to ssh into.
* Have a GUI made with Flask that takes user input and plays the chosen song (runs on local server).


Goals:
* MVP: Allow the user to choose a song on the GUI and have it play on the LEDs
* Stretch Goal: Incorporate various music analysis libraries to modulate color based on certain audio characteristics


Future Work:
* Connecting the FFT analysis to the GUI to the RasPi
* Playing with color representation
* Soldering/building the final sculpture


Questions/Discussion:
* How does the user want to interact with the sculpture?
* How do we get the web app online (not just a local server)?
* How should we represent color?
* How to connect the GUI with the RaspPi?
