Feedback and Decisions: The problem that we are currently facing is how to connect the GUI with the Raspberry Pi and the LEDs. The feedback we got was to run the GUI directly on the Raspberry Pi instead of trying to create a website with the GUI. We also asked for what type of music people might like to see visualized. We got a wide variety of responses, but people also suggested that we try to visualize other sounds such as conversations, white noise, and famous speeches. We got a lot of feedback on what to create for an LED sculpture. People we generally against just a simple 2d bar graph because that could easily be visualized on a computer. We are currently planning on making a 3d helix-like structure with the LEDs. 


Review Process Reflection: 
This review went fairly well. I felt like we ran out of things to talk about during the last few minutes of the review, but then we started talking about the shape of the LED sculpture and how it would be cool if it wasn’t just a plain bar graph. We believe that we provided enough context for our audience, and we don’t think that there was much confusion surrounding our project. The technical review was not as vague this time because we have a better idea of what our final project is going to look like and most of the coding is already completed. We did an sort of ideation session to talk about the LED sculpture which went well. If we were to have another technical review, we might go into more depth about the metastructure of the code, and what we could do to improve its integration since we currently have a set of working parts, but not a whole program.


Summary: 
* Build a more interesting LED sculpture
* Run the GUI Web App right off of the raspberry pi - don’t bother actually putting in on the internet
* Switch from pygame to something else to run the music
* Try types of audio other than sound (white noise, conversations etc.)




Future Course of Action: 
1. Build the LED sculpture
2. Get the math behind the LED visualization correct (having issues with a bunch of for loops currently)
3. Sync up the music and the visualization (probably going to be a trial and error process)
4. Get everything working with the raspberry pi
